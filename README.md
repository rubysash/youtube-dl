# youtube-dl
Downloads from Youtube using Pytube.   You can download public playlists or public videos in audio or video format.    It's mostly just a tool for me to learn code. I know other variants already exist such as the binary of the same name.

# WHY?
* NO Ads
* Privacy/Tracking Issues
* If internet is bad, you can queue up and watch after it downloads
* You can bulk get massive lists in minutes
* no wifi on device but you want offline media?

# PRE-REQUISITES
You need git, linux should be easy, but on windows that is:
https://git-scm.com/download/win
I chose bash style, as admin and accepted other defaults

# INSTALL (use git not pypi):
pip uninstall pytube
pip uninstall pytube3
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/nficano/pytube

# USAGE

After you  install python and the modules it requires on your device, then open a command prompt or double click the script and just answer the blue questions:

If video the saved files will start with a v
if audio the saved files will start with an a

# PLAYLISTS

1. Make them yourself then save videos to your list, make it public
2. Use the youtube music to find pre-made playlists, ie: https://music.youtube.com/search?q=christmas+music
3. Use a google search to find one like:   "christmas music" inurl:playlist site:youtube.com
